## Rulesets
The collaborators will follow these rulesets when making changes to the story.

1. Create a feature branch with a base from develop. This feature will take all the changes for your particular sprint during the scrum and will need to be reviewed.
2. Each optional boss will be contained in it's own .twee file.
3. All .twee files need to be edited from Twinery only. They cannot be edited from a text editor.
4. Please make sure all grammar is correct and all proper nouns are consistently spelled.
5. Ensure that your feature is correctly rebased from the updated develop branch before submitting a pull request.

Until more complexity is made, all .twee files can stay in the root directory.
